# VBA-Challenge
This assignment is to analyzed the stock Market for three years from 2018,2019 and 2020 by using VBA. 

***Objective***

The main goal of this challenge is to develop a robust VBA script capable of iterating across for the three years Stock Market Analysis to compute and output critical 

performance metrics. The script will systematically loop through each stock and gather the following information:

-Ticker Symbol: Uniquely identifying each stock.

-Yearly Change: The difference between the opening price at the year's commencement and the closing price at the year's end.

-Percentage Change: This represents the yearly change as a percentage of the opening price.

-Total Stock Volume: The sum of the traded volume for the stock throughout the year.

-Also, the script will be equipped to identify key performers in the dataset by reporting stocks with the Greatest % Increase, Greatest % Decrease, and Greatest Total Volume. This will provide a snapshot of the most significant movements within the market over the course of the year.

-To make sure comprehensive analysis, the script will be designed to run across multiple worksheets, which will allow for an analysis of data from different years in a single execution. This approach aims to provide a more holistic view of stock performance trends over time, enhancing the decision-making process for investors.
